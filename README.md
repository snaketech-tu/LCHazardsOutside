Hazards Outside
===============  

Introducing the "Lethal Company: Outdoors Hazards Edition" mod – because why confine chaos and calamity to the comfort of four walls?  
This mod will let you spawn landmines, turrets and even modded hazards outside with spawn rates configurable to your liking.

So, if you've ever thought to yourself, "Gee, I love Lethal Company, but wouldn't it be great if it tried to kill me in the great outdoors?" – well, this mod's got your back.  
Literally. Because there's probably a turret back there too. Happy surviving!

Features
--------
- Seeded hazard spawns so they can be replicated. Try it out on challenge moons!
- Configuration for each hazard.
- Modded moons are supported (if added to the game correctly). Successfully tested with Evaisa's teleport traps from [LethalThings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalThings/).
- "Safe" zones for turret spawns to avoid game breaking (because that's no fun).
- Fire exits should be relatively safe, although this may change in the future.
