Hazards Outside
===============  

Introducing the "Lethal Company: Outdoors Hazards Edition" mod – because why confine chaos and calamity to the comfort of four walls?  
This mod will let you spawn landmines, turrets and even modded hazards outside with spawn rates configurable to your liking.

So, if you've ever thought to yourself, "Gee, I love Lethal Company, but wouldn't it be great if it tried to kill me in the great outdoors?" – well, this mod's got your back.  
Literally. Because there's probably a turret back there too. Happy surviving!

Details
--------
- Seeded hazard spawns so they can be replicated. Try it out on challenge moons!
- Configuration for each hazard.
- Modded moons are partially supported due to different layer usage.
- Modded hazards are supported (if added to the game correctly). Successfully tested with Evaisa's teleport traps from [LethalThings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalThings/).
- "Safe" zones for turret spawns to avoid game breaking (because that's no fun).
- Fire exits should be relatively safe, although this may change in the future.

Installation
------------  

- Install BepinEx.
- Place BepInEx/plugins/LCHazardsOutside.dll in your BepInEx/plugins folder.
- That's it! Only the host needs this mod installed! Amazing!

Upcoming features
-----------------

- Spawn rate configuration per moon. This includes both vanilla and modded moons.
- Various configurable spawn strategies. This could include making fire exits less safe, or having a turret guard an exit.
- A global chance that there are no hazards at all outside.

Known issues
------------

- Some slopes can give the hazard a slightly off rotation.
- Rotation does not work at all on Vow for some reason.
- An unreasonably high number of hazards could cause stability problems (this definitely needs more testing).
